De Morgans law : The complement of the union of two sets is the intersection of their complements and the complement of the intersection of two sets is the union of their complements.

This is a follow-up to the question 836. Rectangle Overlap

// There are primarily 3 scenarios.

scenario 1 (partly overlapping):
ax1-----------ax2
       bx1-----------bx2

scenario 2 (fully overlapping):
ax1-----------ax2
     bx1-bx2

scenario 3 (no overlapping):
ax1-----------ax2
                    bx1-----------bx2
					
Hence, intersection can be discovered by:

* determining the greater of the two starting locations
* calculating the smaller of the two endpoints

         int x1 = max(rec1[0],rec2[0]);
		 int x2 = min(rec1[2],rec2[2]);
		 
         int y1 = max(rec1[1],rec2[1]);
         int y2 = min(rec1[3],rec2[3]);
        
         // if(x1 < x2 && y1 < y2) then there is an overlap between two rectangles.
         // else, there isn't.
